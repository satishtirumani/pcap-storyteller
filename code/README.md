## 🌟 Why PCAP StoryTeller? (The Problem)

Traditional tools like **Wireshark** are built for experts but often overwhelm students with "Data Overload." 

- **The Wireshark Problem**: 50,000 packets look like a confusing spreadsheet. It's hard to see the "Story."
- **Our Solution**: We automatically **Link** related events (DNS ➔ HTTP ➔ TLS) and use **Heuristic Intelligence** to flag hacker behavior so you can focus on the investigation, not the noise.

## 🎓 Educational Curriculum

We have organized a complete 9-module learning path in the `documentation/` folder:

1.  [**00 | Intro & Problem Statement**](documentation/00_Introduction_and_Problem_Statement.md) - Why forensics is hard and how we fix it.
2.  [**01 | Definitions & Terminology**](documentation/01_Definitions_and_Terminology.md) - DNS as a phonebook, Packets as envelopes.
3.  [**02 | Tech Stack & Libraries**](documentation/02_Tech_Stack_and_Flask_Libraries.md) - Why we use Flask, Scapy, and Folium.
4.  [**03 | Parsing Pipeline Deep-Dive**](documentation/03_Parsing_Pipeline_Deep_Dive.md) - The 2-pass engine explained.
5.  [**05 | Threat Detection Heuristics**](documentation/05_Threat_Detection_Heuristics.md) - Behavioral analysis vs. virus databases.
6.  [**08 | Teaching Flow**](documentation/08_Teaching_Flow_Curriculum.md) - A guide for classroom instruction.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🕵️ The Investigator (Parser)
- **2-Pass Pipeline**: Identifies conversations first, then analyzes protocol details.
- **Intelligent Linking**: Automatically correlates DNS queries with their resulting TCP/HTTP connections.
- **Unified Handlers**: Specialized "Experts" for DNS, HTTP, TLS, ICMP, and more.

### 🧠 The Security Guard (Threats)
- **Heuristic Engine**: Detects Port Scanning and DNS Tunneling via behavior, not just signatures.
- **Risk Scoring**: Calculates a math-based severity score (0-100) for every IP address.

### 🌍 The Global View (Geomap)
- **Dual-API strategy**: Uses `ipinfo.io` and `ip-api.com` to map attackers globally.
- **Interactive Leaflet Maps**: Real-world "pins" showing where traffic originates.

# This uses our simplified setup.py to fetch everything automatically
pip install .
```

### 🏃 Run the Application
